Androids
An android is a <b> robot[1] </b> or other artificial being[2][3][4] often made from a flesh-like material.[2] Historically, androids were completely within the domain of science fiction and frequently seen in film and television, but advances in robot technology now allow the design of functional and realistic[5] humanoid robots.[6]
